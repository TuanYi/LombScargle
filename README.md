# LombScargle
This is a toolbox written in Mathematica, providing basic tools to analyse light curve data from surveys.

Currently supported surveys: Catalina, ASAS-SN, ZTF, NEOWISE.

Please feel free to use, modify, and distribute this toolbox.

Any suggestions to improve the code or bug reports are most welcome!

[data]: folder to contain the light curve files. You should put the raw light curve data file in this folder.

[kernel]ï¼šmodules for data import, LombScargle, and other useful tools.  

[look.nb]: notebook that demonstrate how to use the tools to find the periodicity of a given lightcurve.

[results]: you can export any results you want in this folder
